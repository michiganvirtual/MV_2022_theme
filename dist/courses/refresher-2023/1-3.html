        <p>
          Psychological First Aid is an evidence-informed approach that helps in
          the immediate aftermath of disaster and terrorism.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach is used with children, adolescents, parents, families,
          and you as a caregiver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psychological First Aid is designed to reduce the initial distress
          caused by traumatic events. It promotes short- and long-term adaptive
          functioning and coping. It is based on an understanding that disaster
          survivors and others affected by the event will experience a broad
          range of early reactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This approach offers emotional support, safety, and practical
          information and assistance. When reactions cause severe distress and
          disorientation, recovery can be helped with support and compassion
          from those administering Psychological First Aid. Assistance and
          resources are provided for immediate needs and concerns. Handouts are
          also provided throughout the course of recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          Psychological First Aid is delivered by mental health workers,
          disaster response workers, and first responders. These providers may
          be embedded in a variety of response units as part of an organized
          disaster response effort.

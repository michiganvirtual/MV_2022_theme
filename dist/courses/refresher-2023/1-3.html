              Psychological First Aid is designed to reduce the initial distress
              caused by traumatic events. It promotes short- and long-term
              adaptive functioning and coping. It is based on an understanding
              that disaster survivors and others affected by the event will
              experience a broad range of early reactions.

              This approach offers emotional support, safety, and practical
              information and assistance. When reactions cause severe distress

              compassion from those administering Psychological First Aid.
              Assistance and resources are provided for immediate needs and
              concerns. Handouts are also provided throughout the course of

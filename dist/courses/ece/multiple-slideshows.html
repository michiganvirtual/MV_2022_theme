            >According to www.childcare.net</a
          >, the turnover rate for child care employees is one of the highest of
          any occupation. Turnover is a challenge across the field. Let’s look
          at some strategies that you can do throughout the hiring and on-going
          support phases of working with and retaining staff.

            <p>
              Not only is it additional publicity for your program, but posting
              your job opening to an online newspaper or Craigslist site can
              also get your job opening in front of a much wider employee
              market! Local colleges and community colleges are also another
              source to consider for job postings.

              Not only will this provide you with a written sample from the
              applicant, it will also help you see what their values and beliefs
              are relating to children, working with families, and working with
              others. While answers could be made up that sound good, take some
              time to ask applicants for more information when you interview
              them. Be sure if you use this form that you use it with every
              applicant for the position you’re interviewing for. Otherwise, an
              applicant could claim that they were discriminated against during
              the hiring process.

            <h3>Offer competitive wages, within your budget.</h3>
            <p>
              Be sure you keep your budget updated so you know how much you’re
              able to offer staff. Do your homework to learn what a local
              competitive wage is and be sure that you set your child care rates
              high enough to cover program costs, including offering a
              competitive wage.

            <h3>Offer benefits.</h3>
            <p>
              While not every program will be able to offer full benefits such
              as medical or dental insurance, you can offer other benefit
              options to staff such as Paid Time Off, holiday, or vacation pay.
              Knowing what you can offer means knowing what your budget can
              support, so, be sure that you keep your budget updated! Develop
              partnerships with organizations. Look outside your program and
              with local businesses. Some local businesses offer discounts to
              teachers! Take advantage of this and see if they will extend these
              discounts to your staff. It never hurts to ask, and you’ll never
              know until you ask!

              Taking your time to find candidates with the right job fit and
              organizational fit may take longer during the hiring process, but
              it will reduce turnover and save you time in the long-run.

              The ability of any organization to accomplish its goals depends on
              a skilled and capable workforce! Quality doesn’t just happen, it’s
              always the result of intentional effort, which includes training
              efforts! Be sure you encourage and provide training opportunities
              both within and outside of your program. If you’re on a tight
              budget, you can still offer excellent professional development!
              Lead a book study with your staff, or, for FCC providers, read a
              book yourself! Some excellent ones for staff discussion
              include:<em>
                Einstein Never Used Flashcards and Mind in the Making (both
                available on Amazon)</em
              >. NAEYC also offers a wide range of resources and suggested books
              that would also be good resources.

              Staff development is an on-going process. After a well-designed
              on-boarding (training) process, be sure you are checking in to see
              how things are going, offering a refresher if needed, and helping
              staff to develop new skills or take on new responsibilities as
              they are ready for them.

              Leaders (that’s you!) who want to keep their fingers on the
              “pulse” of their programs regularly check in with staff and
              parents alike. Weekly conversations with staff around the
              following questions can help you stay connected, help staff feel
              supported, and help keep your program growing!

            Questions to ask the staff:
            <ul>
              <li>How was your week?</li>
              <li>What are some successes you’ve had this week?</li>
              <li>
                Are there any problems you’re having that I can help you with?
              </li>
              <li>
                Do you have any concerns about the overall operation of the
                program or any suggestions for improving?

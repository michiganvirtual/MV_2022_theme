        <p>
          Great Start to Quality (GSQ) is Michigan’s quality recognition and
          improvement system for licensed child care providers that want to have
          their programs evaluated and take steps to improve their quality. It
          is funded by the Department of Michigan Lifelong Education,
          Advancement, and Potential (MiLEAP) and includes

        <h2>Getting Started with The Quality Improvement Process</h2>
        <p>
          If a program chooses to participate in Quality Improvement through
          GSQ, the process is fully supported along the way. Programs will have
          multiple opportunities to engage in reflection and self-assessment on
          their own using a variety of tools provided by GSQ. Later in the
          process, programs will benefit from trained Assessors observing and
          providing feedback and data.

          GSQ believes Quality Improvement is a continuous process — a journey
          without end. There is always new research and learnings in the field
          of Early Care and Education and in the new process, programs are
          encouraged and supported to continue to reflect on their practices, in
          line with the program’s mission. This can assist programs in creating
          goals that ensure the best quality care for the children and families
          they serve.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are now levels of Quality. All published quality levels are
          valid for 2 years and results will be posted for families on the
          program’s public profile where families search for care. Select each

        <h1>Branching Activity Landing Page</h1>
        <p>
          Replace this paragraph text with any supporting content or a
          description of this activity so that learners have the information
          they need in order to understand the nature of this branching
          activity. You must include the following navigation note so that
          learners understand that there will temporarily be 2 navigation
          options visible to them.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          You'll include a note on the activity conclusion page later, which
          will direct learners to return to the regular Brightspace-native
          navigation arrows.&nbsp;

          Once you have selected one of the following buttons, the navigation
          will change slightly for the rest of this module. Until directed to do
          differently,
          <strong>use the buttons at the bottom of the following pages</strong>
          to either move ahead or return to a previous page within each topic
          instead of using the arrows at the top right of your screen.

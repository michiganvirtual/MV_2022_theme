          One of the strongest practices for making the right hire is looking
          for a candidate who is both the right job fit and the right
          organization/program fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The right job fit candidate has the right skills and experience to
          actually do the job. The right organization/program fit is the
          candidate whose values, communication style, and commitment to
          teamwork match your organization’s culture. Hiring the right person
          means looking for both of these fits.
        </p>
        <p>An ideal candidate will be a good job fit and a good program fit.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Job fit- They have the skills and education to do this job.</li>
          <li>
            Organization fit- Their values, attitude, communication style, and
            teamwork ability match the culture of our program.
          </li>
        </ul>

                Ms. Badawi is a good organizational fit but doesn’t have the
                experience to be a good job fit. With training, Ms. Badawi could
                be a good hire.</strong

                prefers to work alone. While he never had direct conflicts with
                other staff, his attitude showed he’d rather not work with

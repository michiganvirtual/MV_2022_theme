              As we covered in the budget process, it will be very helpful to
              look at what has happened in the past. You’ll be able to see what
              costs have remained constant and what may vary from year to year.
              Looking back at one year is good, but it’s even better to look
              back at expenses over multiple years. This will help you
              understand if there is consistency from year to year or if you
              have major fluctuations. If the latter is true, you will need to
              understand what causes the fluctuations in order to project future
              expenses.

              Expenses need to be organized into two categories: fixed and
              variable.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-2">
              Fixed expenses are basic operating costs that must be paid and
              tend to remain consistent from period‐to‐period, like rent or
              mortgage costs, liability insurance, etc. You know the total cost
              that you can assign to your program for the year and they won’t
              change unless something significant changes in your program. You
              can accurately anticipate these costs.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-2">
              Variable expenses are the things that can go up or down based on
              changes in your program. For example, if your enrollment changes,
              your food, supplies, and materials costs may change, too. These
              costs are dependent on enrollment and other changes.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-2">
              Understanding the difference between predictable fixed costs and
              variable costs that require more consideration (like enrollment)
              is very important when building a budget and projecting costs
              throughout the year. In order to budget for variable expenses
              you’ll need to consider what influences those costs and what may
              be different than in prior years, if the cost is recurring. If a
              cost is new, you won’t have the benefit of historical information
              and you’ll need to closely monitor actual expenses against your
              assumptions throughout the year.

              What are your goals for the coming year? No matter how small or
              big–it’s vital to think through the costs associated with
              achieving your goal and where you’ll source the income to pay for
              it. This prevents surprises at the end of the year, like realizing
              that spending exceeded program income. Building a budget and
              reviewing it throughout the year will help prevent unexpected
              detrimental outcomes.

              Shared services are a way for providers to work together to share
              costs and deliver services in a more streamlined and efficient
              way. Similar programs can share administrative functions, like
              financial and marketing services, as well as benefit from
              purchasing pools with vendor discounts for things that they
              already purchase, like food, supplies, and payroll services.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-2">
              The money saved on shared services can be redirected back into
              your program to work on goals like participating in or increasing
              your quality rating and improvement system (QRIS) level and
              improving program quality for children.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-2">
              The ultimate goal of shared services is to reduce the
              administrative burden on providers and free up time and money to
              be redirected into providing high quality care for children.
              Michigan doesn’t currently have a formal shared services platform;
              however, there are some excellent resources on the Great Start to
              Quality website that include a job board, quality resources and a
              place to checkout available savings for providers:

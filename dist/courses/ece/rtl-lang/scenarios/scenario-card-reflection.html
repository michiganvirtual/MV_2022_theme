                It’s the first day of your new job. You arrive at your new job
                excited and maybe a bit nervous. When you get to the center, the
                person who is sitting at the front desk doesn’t know who you
                are. They weren’t told that someone new was starting that day.
                The director isn’t available because she had an appointment
                outside the center that morning. One of the teachers that you
                met when you interviewed recognizes you but is busy with her
                classroom, so she can’t really stop to talk or help you. You’re
                told to wait, and the director should be back soon. When the
                director arrives, she hands you a folder full of paperwork and
                tells you to read it and complete the forms that are inside. She
                leads you down to your new classroom and tells you to go on in
                and introduce yourself to the other teacher. She apologizes that
                she can’t spend more time with you, but she has another meeting
                that she needs to get to. You never see her again for the rest
                of the day.

                    It is important to involve more people than just the
                    director. Include both management and peers so that the new
                    hire can learn from multiple people. Bringing other staff
                    into the orientation process helps distribute the
                    responsibilities and allows for feedback on new employee
                    performance from multiple perspectives. Consider assigning
                    another peer staff member as a mentor to a new employee.
                    This helps to create an intentional connection with another
                    staff member and gives the new employee someone to ask
                    questions of who isn’t a supervisor.

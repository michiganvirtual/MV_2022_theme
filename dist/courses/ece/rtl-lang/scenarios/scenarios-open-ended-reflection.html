          When the time comes to enforce contracts, all of your hard work
          outlining and communicating policies and documenting agreements will
          pay off. While contracts can be either verbal or written, it is best
          to have everything in writing when building and protecting your
          business.
        </p>
        <p>Still need convincing to get everything in writing?</p>
        <div class="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-1 gap-4 mb-12">
          <div

          >
            <h2 class="">Consider this scenario:</h2>
            <p class="md:text-lg font-normal">
              A new family contacts you about enrolling their child in your
              center. You share the child care fees and the parent agrees to pay
              $250 a week for child care. At the end of the first week, the
              parent picks up their child and leaves without paying. When you
              contact them, they share that they thought it was $250 per month.
              If you had written child care policies and fee requirements and a
              contract everyone would have been clear about expectations.
              Moreover, written documentation helps protect your program from
              miscommunication and potential legal issues.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Another important question to ask yourself when it comes time to
          effectively enforce your contract and program policies is if you’ve
          clearly defined the rules and consistently follow them. If you
          frequently bend rules to fit different situations or you aren’t
          consistent in how you apply them, you will run into challenges when it
          is necessary to hold family or staff accountable.
        </p>

            <h2 class="">Consider this example:</h2>
            <p class="md:text-lg font-normal">
              Your contract says parents are given one week of unpaid tuition
              “vacation” per year. Jamal attends 3 days a week and his mother
              informs you that they will be gone for the next two weeks and he
              will miss five days of care. She requests those five days that
              span almost two weeks as her vacation week. When you try to
              explain that each child is allocated just one vacation week, she
              points out that this is not clearly defined in the contract. What
              do you do now? It will be hard to enforce your contract if you
              haven’t clearly defined the policy and it can be interpreted in
              different ways. You will need to revise your contract in the
              future to define exactly what a “vacation” week is. Is a vacation
              week five free days for everyone or is it the number of days the
              child normally attends? Have it in writing and think through
              possible alternative interpretations so you don’t get into sticky
              situations like the one with Jamal’s mother.
            </p>

        </div>
        <p>Here are a few top tips for enforcing contracts:</p>
        <ul style="padding-right: 40px">
          <li>
            Adequately describe all consequences for not complying with a policy
            or contract requirement in writing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid vague or incomplete language to avert communication problems
            with families and save time that you would otherwise have to spend
            constantly reassessing your policy and the actions necessary to
            enforce the policy in every situation that arises.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consistently define and enforce the rules so parents and staff don’t
            feel you are being unfair or showing favoritism.
          </li>
          <li>
            Eliminate rules you aren’t willing to enforce—inconsistent
            application can create conflict and potential legal issues.
          </li>
        </ul>

            Your plan of action may depend on your budget. Do you have the

            so, you may accept their proposal, but only if you develop a new
            contract that states the new schedule clearly, including late
            payment fees and process, and everyone agrees to it in writing.

            more information about when the parent will have the money for the
            registration fee so you have a complete understanding of the
            situation. Then, consider offering to hold the child’s enrollment
            spot until the program fee can be made, if you have the space to do
            so.

            If you never communicated a policy about Monday withdrawals, it’s

            insufficient. Moreover, a lack of communication like this can harm
            your credibility and relationships with families. Imagine yourself
            in their shoes—how would you feel not knowing when money would be
            withdrawn from your account? Return to best practices—repair the
            relationship, add your policy in writing, communicate it clearly
            with parents, ideally in writing, and then enforce it consistently.

            There is no perfect answer for unusual and difficult situations like
            this. Your response will depend on the situation and it may be in
            your best interest to gather information from them first, consult
            with colleagues or a resource center, and then return to the family
            with a compassionate and clear answer. As child care providers and
            administrators, we are an important piece of a social safety net for
            our families, and, at the very least, we must provide resources to
            help with extenuating circumstances.

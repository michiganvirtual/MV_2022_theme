          Once you’ve determined your base tuition rates, you’ll dive deeper
          into the many small and big opportunities to shape additional fee
          structures for your program and the services you offer. Alongside this
          process, you’ll likely conduct market research to better understand
          what similar programs are offering in your area. Engaging in this
          process will help you be competitive in the marketplace and more
          likely to achieve full enrollment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Remember that tuition <em>must</em> cover costs for your business to
          be successful. There should also be additional funding to fill any
          gaps. How you structure your program to make this happen will change
          from year to year.
        </p>
        <h2>Balancing Tuition and Fees</h2>
        <p>
          The first place to start when fine-tuning tuition and fees is to look
          at different ways to balance them depending on your program’s unique
          needs.

                  <strong>Registration fees:</strong> These are usually one-time
                  or yearly fees that cover the cost of processing all the
                  paperwork required for enrollment.
                </p>
                <p class="font-normal mb-2">
                  <strong>Holding fees:</strong> A deposit or fee for reserving
                  an enrollment space for a child is commonplace. This protects
                  your business and ensures families are serious about enrolling
                  in your program. If you hold a space and then the family
                  cancels, you may not be able to fill that space quickly,
                  therefore losing revenue you had been expecting. A holding fee
                  can help bridge that gap.

                <p class="font-normal mb-2">
                  Many programs don’t offer part-time care because it doesn’t
                  offer the same reliable income source as full-time care and it
                  requires a lot more administrative work to juggle multiple
                  families on different care schedules. Moreover, a part-time
                  schedule can be difficult for some children that thrive on
                  routine.
                </p>
                <p class="font-normal mb-2">
                  Acknowledging these challenges to your program, it’s standard
                  practice to charge higher daily rates for part‐time children.
                  For example, increase your hourly rate by 20%-30% if you will
                  only be caring for a child for 1-2 days per week.
                </p>
                <p class="font-normal mb-2">
                  While you may prefer full-time enrollment, be open to adding
                  part-time enrollments. It can help fill spaces in your program
                  that would otherwise be empty. Moreover, the lower daily or
                  hourly cost for full-time care may be all the incentive you
                  need to get full-time enrollments.

                  Many programs arrange special activities for a fee during
                  normal business hours. Examples can include enrichment
                  programming like fitness or mindfulness training from a
                  qualified coach, more individualized attention from a tutor,
                  or playing games that increase cognitive development. These
                  add-on fees are separate from base tuition, optional, and
                  clearly defined in fee structures.

                  Materials fees can be assessed yearly, quarterly, or
                  bi-annually and usually go towards the cost of supplies. These

                  If a need exists and you have the staffing to cover it, add on

                    ongoing service or a monthly caregiver’s night out, for
                    example. Be sure to include this in the fee structure so
                    families know this is an available service and advertise
                    with plenty of time to ensure you have the staff available

                    <strong>Drop-in care:</strong> This is all dependent on
                    available space in your program. If you are at capacity,
                    parents will need to pre-arrange drop-in care as available.
                    If your program has available space, it will be easier to
                    accommodate families for drop-in care. Drop-in care fees are
                    usually more expensive than regular tuition because programs
                    cannot depend on this as a reliable source of income and
                    benefit from the consistency of routine contract care.

                  <strong>Late pick up fees:</strong> No matter what time your
                  center closes, it’s important to hold parents accountable for
                  picking their children up on time. Many child care centers do
                  this by charging late pick up fees that heavily incentivize
                  parents to pick their kids up on time. It’s not uncommon for a
                  child care center to charge families a dollar or more for
                  every minute they’re late picking up their child. Your program
                  will have to pay additional staffing costs when families are
                  late picking their children up and this can be costly,
                  especially if staff need to be paid overtime wages.

                  it not only helps you keep cash flowing into your business,
                  but it saves all the time that would need to be redirected
                  into following up on payments and adjusting the budget.

          Whether it’s your program’s first year or fifteenth, you will want to
          complete an annual review of market needs by gathering information
          about child care programs in your area. Thoroughly knowing the market
          will help you decide what kind of programming to offer and how much
          you could charge for tuition.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if your program price is much higher than comparable
          programs in your area, families may choose to enroll at a lower cost
          program. If your price is too low, you may not be able to cover the
          cost of your expenses or compensate your employees fairly. Beyond
          understanding how you compare to market rates, you will also need to
          consider increased costs from one year to the next.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond helping you plan better financially, market research is a great
          way to see what other programs exist and get ideas and inspiration for
          your own program. You may want to gather your information using this

        <p>
          Before you begin your market research, it’s important to understand
          the difference between market research and price fixing. Price fixing
          is an agreement among competitors to raise, lower, maintain, or
          stabilize prices. This can be an agreement that is written, verbal, or
          inferred from conduct. Price fixing is illegal. Potential penalties
          include imprisonment (up to ten years) and large fines up to $1
          million for individuals, $100 million for companies, or twice the gain
          or loss from the offense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, the antitrust laws require that each company establish
          prices and other competitive terms on its own, without agreeing with a
          competitor. As you may already know, child care programs across the
          country regularly talk with each other about many topics, including
          fees, and, in some cases, are even unknowingly in violation of this
          law. For example, it is against the law for a child care director in a
          town or community to call another director within that same community
          and share plans to increase the program’s child care fees. Courts
          would likely view this as price fixing, and it is a violation of
          federal antitrust laws.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a program director, there are legal ways to gain information for
          your market research. For example:
        </p>
        <ul style="padding-left: 40px">
          <li>
            Contact your local Resource Center or local chapter of NAEYC. They
            may have rate information that is reported to them or that is
            publicly available.
          </li>
          <li>
            Review rates in local child care program ads. These are sometimes
            also posted on Craigslist or in Classified Ads.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check competitor websites and request information while refraining
            from conversations with other programs and administration about
            changing or “fixing” rates.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid engaging in any sort of dialogue that could be seen as an
            agreement. When in doubt, err towards the side of caution. It’s okay

                You’re at a professional development conference in your
                community and start talking to some of the other administrators
                and directors of other child care centers. You are all
                struggling with one of the same dilemmas—your infant rooms are
                full and you have a waiting list, but still you are struggling
                to make ends meet on the budget every quarter. One administrator
                suggests that you raise your infant prices together. Since the
                demand is high, you might as well all start charging more for
                the limited spaces you have available. The extra income will let
                everyone have a little more cushion room on the budget, which is
                ultimately good for everyone. Is this a good strategy?

              No, agreeing with a competitor to change your prices is an example
              of price fixing and it’s illegal. Remember, potential penalties
              include imprisonment (up to ten years) and large fines up to $1
              million for individuals, $100 million for companies, or twice the
              gain or loss from the offense. Instead of setting prices together,
              collaborate with other programs on different ways you each earn
              additional income. Maybe one of your competitors hosted a
              successful pancake breakfast fundraiser and they are happy to
              share their learnings from it with you so that you can host your
              own. It’s okay to talk about the issues you have in common, but
              it’s not okay to price fix.

              After working tirelessly on different budget scenarios, you’ve
              finally established the bottom rate for your tuition to ensure
              that you at least break even. When you start researching other
              comparable programs in your area, you find that they are charging,
              on average, $2 more per hour for care. Using your budgeting tool,
              you raise all your tuition rates by $2/hour. You feel guilty
              raising the rates so much at first, but as you continue using your
              budgeting workbook, you realize that raising rates will allow you
              to offer income-based discounts and scholarship slots that you
              couldn’t otherwise afford. You will also be able to afford a small
              raise for all employees. You decide to go through with the $2/hour
              increase since it is in line with the market and will give your
              program space in the budget for quality improvements. Is this a
              good strategy?

              For years, your center has offered full-time care from 6 am-6 pm 5
              days a week. Recently, you’ve seen a decline in early morning
              attendance. It’s been difficult to find staff to cover the early
              morning and late afternoon hours anyway, so you decide to overhaul
              the schedule and create a shorter base day schedule with an
              optional early bird and evening program. Base tuition will
              decrease and early bird and evening enrollment will be an extra
              cost commensurate with the increased cost to keep the program open
              for extended hours. With the financial commitment from parents
              that need extended care, you can more accurately gauge the staff
              required and create schedules that better accommodate the needs of
              everyone. Is this a good strategy?

              An administrator from one of the child care centers across town
              calls to share with you their plan to raise enrollment and waiting
              list fees to make up for their budget shortfall. She knows your
              budget is always tight and thought it would be helpful for your
              program to match their fees. Since their fees sound reasonable for
              the amount of work it takes to run all the administrative
              processing for your center, too, you agree and raise your fees. Is

              While it may be true that your budget is tight, you cannot agree

              do, reach out to a trained professional or consult with one of the
              many agencies built to help child care centers succeed.

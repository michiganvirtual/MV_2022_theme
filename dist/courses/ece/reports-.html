              There is a decrease in revenue due to a drop in enrollment. Which
              of the following ideas represent a short-term solution?
              <br />
              <strong>Option A</strong> Enroll children for the days when you
              are not at capacity.
              <br />
              <strong>Option B</strong> Assess current tuition rates and fees
              and ensure they cover the cost of care.
              <br />
              <strong>Option C</strong> Refer to your marketing plan for ways to
              fill the opening as quickly as possible.
              <br />
              <strong>Option D</strong> Compare your rates to other provider
              rates and adjust according to market trends.
              <br />
              <strong>Option E</strong> Give all families surveys to understand
              why they stay or leave. Prioritize exit surveys. <br /><strong
                >Option F</strong
              >

              solving a decrease in enrollment, looking to a marketing plan and

              solutions because they fix the immediate problem, but don’t find
              the underlying root causes of the issue.</span

              Expenses have increased due to heating costs rising because of a
              very cold winter. What can you do immediately to help maintain the
              fiscal health of your program and stay on budget?
              <br />
              <strong>Option A</strong> Be sure that you have compared prices of
              various vendors and are paying the lowest price for the products
              and services you need.
              <br />
              <strong>Option B</strong> Consider shared services opportunities
              in your area.
              <br />
              <strong>Option C</strong> Cut discretionary expenses that can be
              put on hold until the finances improve, including anything that
              can be eliminated without jeopardizing the program operations.
              <br />
              <strong>Option D</strong> Tell everyone to bundle up and turn down
              the heat! </label

              >Response Submitted. Cutting discretionary expenses immediately
              that don’t affect program quality is a good short-term strategy.
              For example, reduce waste and unnecessary expenses by monitoring
              and tracking supplies like food to eliminate overstocking and
              spoilage. Shared services and comparing vendor prices are both
              great ideas, but more long-term solutions. While turning down the
              heat could reduce expenses, remember the temperature regulations
              must be followed. Moreover, you don’t want to compromise the
              quality of care or comfort for the children.</span

              Cash flow is negative because of an increase in families who
              haven’t paid tuition on time. Which of the following fixes would
              be long-term solutions?
              <br />
              <strong>Option A</strong> Set up a payment plan for families past
              due to pay down the balance.
              <br />
              <strong>Option B</strong> Consider other available sources of
              income, for example, a line of credit that you can draw from
              temporarily.
              <br />
              <strong>Option C</strong> If you do not have a line of credit with
              a bank, establish one you can use in emergency situations.
              <br />
              <strong>Option D</strong> Begin building a savings account to
              support emergency cash shortfalls and unexpected expenses in the
              future.
              <br />
              <strong>Option E</strong> Both Option C and Option D. </label

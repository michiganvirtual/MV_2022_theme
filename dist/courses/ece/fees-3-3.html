              You’re at a professional development conference in your community
              and start talking to some of the other administrators and
              directors of other child care centers. You are all struggling with
              one of the same dilemmas—your infant rooms are full and you have a
              waiting list, but still you are struggling to make ends meet on
              the budget every quarter. One administrator suggests that you
              raise your infant prices together. Since the demand is high, you
              might as well all start charging more for the limited spaces you
              have available. The extra income will let everyone have a little
              more cushion room on the budget, which is ultimately good for
              everyone. Is this a good strategy?

              After working tirelessly on different budget scenarios, you’ve
              finally established the bottom rate for your tuition to ensure
              that you at least break even. When you start researching other
              comparable programs in your area, you find that they are charging,
              on average, $2 more per hour for care. Using your budgeting tool,
              you raise all your tuition rates by $2/hour. You feel guilty
              raising the rates so much at first, but as you continue using your
              budgeting workbook, you realize that raising rates will allow you
              to offer income-based discounts and scholarship slots that you
              couldn’t otherwise afford. You will also be able to afford a small
              raise for all employees. You decide to go through with the $2/hour
              increase since it is in line with the market and will give your
              program space in the budget for quality improvements. Is this a
              good strategy?</label

              For years, your center has offered full-time care from 6 am-6 pm 5
              days a week. Recently, you’ve seen a decline in early morning
              attendance. It’s been difficult to find staff to cover the early
              morning and late afternoon hours anyway, so you decide to overhaul
              the schedule and create a shorter base day schedule with an
              optional early bird and evening program. Base tuition will
              decrease and early bird and evening enrollment will be an extra
              cost commensurate with the increased cost to keep the program open
              for extended hours. With the financial commitment from parents
              that need extended care, you can more accurately gauge the staff
              required and create schedules that better accommodate the needs of
              everyone. Is this a good strategy?</label

              An administrator from one of the child care centers across town
              calls to share with you their plan to raise enrollment and waiting
              list fees to make up for their budget shortfall. She knows your
              budget is always tight and thought it would be helpful for your
              program to match their fees. Since their fees sound reasonable for
              the amount of work it takes to run all the administrative
              processing for your center, too, you agree and raise your fees. Is

                    Communicate with families using a common tool (not everyone
                    uses social media)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Can be more strategic and intentional rather than short,

                  <li>
                    Email is more transactional (e.g., receiving offers) than
                    just social (e.g., chatting with friends)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Don’t think email vs. social media. Instead, they can be
                    used together to maximize your message

                    Email providers such as Gmail offer built-in tools that can
                    analyze the effectiveness of your email campaigns. There are
                    also tools that can be linked to your email account to track
                    effectiveness. An internet search for “email analytics
                    tools” will result in several to choose from.
                  </li>
                  <li>A few metrics to consider tracking include:</li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Open Rate: number of emails that people opened</li>
                    <li>
                      Click-through Rate: amount of emails where people clicked
                      on one or more of the links that were included
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Conversion Rate: the amount of emails where people clicked
                      through and acted on the message inside (e.g., completed
                      an inquiry form)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      You can also track the effectiveness by asking people how
                      they heard about a promotion (e.g., waiving a registration
                      fee). Understanding how many families responded/enrolled
                      after a promotion can provide insight into its
                      effectiveness and confirm if it was a good use of time and
                      resources.

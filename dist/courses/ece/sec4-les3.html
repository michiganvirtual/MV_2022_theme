          Lesson 3: Great Start to Quality: Process for Continuous Improvement

        <p>
          The process of quality improvement never ends. There is always new
          research and learning in the field of Early Care and Education and in
          the new process, programs are encouraged and supported to continue to
          reflect on their practices, in line with the program’s philosophy.
          This can assist programs in creating goals for improvement to ensure
          the best quality care for the children and families they serve.

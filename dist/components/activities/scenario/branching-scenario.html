        <h1 class="">Selecting a Grade-Level Resource</h1>
        <p class="">
          MeL is full of resources that cater to learners of all ages, packed
          with engaging and informative content that can captivate curious
          minds. Each resource is carefully curated to suit a particular age
          group, providing content and appropriate navigation support to young
          learners.
        </p>
        <p class="">
          We understand that choosing the right eResource is important. That's
          why we're here to help! We've selected two resources in this module
          and invite you to focus on the resource that aligns most with your
          work and the grade level group of the students you support.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p class="">
          We recommend finding the grade level group you primarily support and
          exploring the resource content aligned to that selection.
        </p>
        <h2 class="">Navigation Note</h2>

        <p class="mb-6">
          Once you have clicked one of the following buttons, the navigation
          will change slightly for the rest of this module. Be sure
          to&nbsp;<strong
            >follow the directions and use the buttons at the bottom of the
            following pages</strong
          >
          to either move ahead or return to a previous page within each topic
          instead of using the arrows at the top right of your screen.
        </p>
        <p class="font-bold text-xl mb-4">
          Use the following buttons to select the resource you want to explore:

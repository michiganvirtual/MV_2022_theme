          Now that you know more about the modern military, let's read
          Lieutenant Abrams' story.&nbsp; We've included links to pop-ups with
          suggestions about how counseling services could have helped First
          Lieutenant Abrams discover the education and career path that was
          right for him. As you read the story and consider the new suggestions,
          consider similar situations with your students.

              High school was pretty fun for me. That’s when I began to learn
              who I was as a man. I did things early on to try to fit in, but it
              ended up not working out. I was a follower for a brief period of
              time before I learned that it was okay to be myself. If I could
              summarize high school for me, I’d say it wasn’t too bad. I didn’t
              like moving as much as I did, but I managed to get along with
              people everywhere I went. I just always remember feeling like I
              didn’t have a home. I didn’t go to high school in Chicago, and
              that’s where I’m from, but when my mom moved us (my older sister
              and younger brother) away, it was never quite the same. It’s also
              the reason why no matter where I moved, I was always home visiting
              family and friends.

              The Graduation Test
            </h3>
            <p class="mb-2 text-lg font-normal text-dark-gray">
              My senior year was the most interesting year for me because we
              moved to a different state, Savannah, Ga. Savannah was totally
              different from Chicago. The size of the city, the food, and the
              weather, just to name a few. When we got settled and I started
              going to Jenkins high school, it was a culture shock. In addition
              to having a new complete setting, Georgia has what’s called a
              “Graduation Test.” You had to pass this in order to actually be
              eligible for graduation. I met some students that completed high
              school but couldn’t pass a portion of Georgia’s “Graduation Test”;
              therefore, they never received their diploma. Georgia’s
              “Graduation Test” is similar to an SAT or ACT, in which you get
              tested in English, Math, Social Studies, Reading, and Science. In
              each category, you have to meet the qualification of scoring a
              specific score, or else you fail that portion of the test and have
              to retake it at a later time. Long story short, I passed all of
              the tests except for Science and Social Studies.

              I continued to [take the tests] throughout [my senior] year
              leading up to graduation, but I continued to fail. I was getting
              discouraged because I could not pass those two tests to save my
              life. In Chicago, in order to graduate, you’d have to take the
              “Constitution Test” in order to be eligible for graduation. I was
              familiar with the school system in Chicago, IL, but not in
              [Georgia].

              graduation test along with preparing to bring a child into the
              world. There was a lot on the line because if I didn’t pass the

Students who fail a graduation test but have otherwise completed all requirements for graduation can enlist in some branches of service, since not all states require a graduation or exit exam."

                      College is often thought of as a goal in and of itself
                      rather than a means to a larger goal. This might have been
                      a good time to talk about not only requirements for
                      attending college, but how finances and family would play
                      into those plans. The military could be an option into
                      financing college and providing a career trajectory upon
                      graduation. A part-time service commitment might have been
                      a good choice. Students who fail a graduation test but
                      have otherwise completed all requirements for graduation
                      can enlist in some branches of service, since not all
                      states require a graduation or exit exam.

              I knew I wanted to be in a position of power. I also knew that I
              wanted to graduate college with my bachelor’s degree. I came up
              with a plan to be able to do both. Once I graduated with two
              associates from Wilbur Wright (general studies and in science;

              the fall of 2017. The rest is history. Not necessarily history
              because I have so much more I have to accomplish in life, but
              that’s where I was able to stay on track and not only graduate but
              also commission as an Officer in the Army.

              I believe the Army was the right choice for me. I didn’t grow up
              wanting to be in the military, let alone an Officer in the Army,
              but I must say, I’m satisfied. My job is challenging, to say the
              least, but overall, I’m happy that I can provide for my family and
              myself.
